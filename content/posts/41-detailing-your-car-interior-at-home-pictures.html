                Also, apply dressing to the dash, vinyl and leather each time the car is. Detail the car using an old toothbrush. An interior car detail typically includes vacuuming and shampooing the carpet and seats, and wiping down the dashboard.

    <h3>All of the upholstery inside the car is thoroughly vacuumed and shampooed to remove stains and dirt.</h3>
    <p>Detailing your car is no different. I bought a car off a family member and the interior was seriously gross to the point where i thought it was beyond repair. Picking the best car detailing kit isn&#039;t easy, but our choice for the top option is meguiar&#039;s complete car care kit. Yet, ask three professional detailers where to begin and you&#039;ll likely get three different answers!</p>
